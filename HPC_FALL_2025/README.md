# High Performance Computing Micro-credential
## Fall 2025 
This micro-credentialed course provides a foundation for addressing computing-, memory-, or storage-intensive research problems using high-performance computing (HPC). Participants who complete the course will be able to navigate the Linux command line, apply data transfer protocols, find and use software on HPC, and use a scheduler to run batch and interactive jobs. Skills acquired in the course can greatly accelerate problem solving in the computational realm.

Participants who have successfully completed this course have demonstrated the following skills:
  * Registering for a Research Computing account
  * Logging in to a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster using ssh
  * Submitting a help ticket to the Research Computing team
  * Creating directories using Linux terminal commands
  * Copying files using Linux terminal commands
  * Transferring data using Linux terminal commands
  * Transferring data using Globus
  * Creating a batch job for Slurm
  * Scheduling a batch job using Slurm
  * Using slurmtools to monitor job metrics
